##### Second Type of Cue: Venn Diagrams

Venn diagrams have the advantage that they can also represent a logical inference with two premises. Here is an example:

"To be <mark style="background-color: #874fff88">allowed to buy alcohol in Germany</mark>, you must <mark style="background-color: #24CB7188">be of legal age</mark>. Anyone <ins><mark style="background-color: #FF723788">under the age of 18</mark></ins> is considered a <ins><mark style="background-color: #24CB7188">minor</mark></ins>."

The Venn diagram depicts the logical conditions of both premises by shading. Only the areas that are free of shading represent possible situations. It can be seen that legal age is a necessary but not sufficient condition for purchasing alcohol. Being at least 18 years old is a necessary and sufficient condition for legal age.

The Venn diagram of the premises shows which conclusion must apply. All persons who are allowed to purchase alcohol are 18 years of age or older. The unshaded parts of set A are a subset of the unshaded parts of set Y.

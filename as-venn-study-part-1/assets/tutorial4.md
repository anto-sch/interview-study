For the tasks that require you to draw conclusions, the premises of the inference will be visualized. For other tasks, the context describes incomplete or incorrect arguments and ask about required assumptions or flaws in the reasoning. In this case, the Venn diagrams will first show you only the premises of the argument and then the premises combined with the conclusion. This way you can compare the two, to see which assumptions are required. Here is an example:

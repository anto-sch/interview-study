#### Visual Cues

All tasks include visual cues to help you find the solution. Each cue offers support in two ways, text highlighting and logical diagrams.

##### First Cue: Highlighting

The first type of clue is the color coding of the task text. The "if" and "then" parts of the premises and the conclusion are highlighted in color. If two parts are highlighted in the same color, they are either the same statements or a statement and its negation. An example:

"To be <mark style="background-color: #874fff88">allowed to buy alcohol in Germany</mark>, you must <mark style="background-color: #24CB7188">be of legal age</mark>. Anyone <mark style="background-color: #FF723788">under the age of 18</mark> is considered a <mark style="background-color: #24CB7188">minor</mark>. Anyone who is <mark style="background-color: #874fff88">allowed to buy alcohol in Germany</mark> must be <mark style="background-color: #FF723788">18 years of age or older</mark>."

This cue is intended to help you reliably identify the if-then form of declarative sentences, even in cases where negations are present. In case an if-part or then-part is negated, the corresponding text is <mark stlye="text-decoration: underline">underlined</mark>.

##### Second Type of Cue: Venn Diagrams

The second type of cue consists of set diagrams, which are displayed next to the text in addition to the color coding. Each premise and conclusion has its own set diagram. It shows the "if" part and the "then" part of the conditional as two sets. The shading (greyed out area) indicates that the "if" part of the conditional must lie exactly in the intersection and must therefore be a subset of the "then" part. These diagrams are also called Venn diagrams.

An example: The following Venn diagram is displayed for the conditional "To be <mark style="background-color: #874fff88">allowed to buy alcohol in Germany</mark>, you must <mark style="background-color: #24CB7188">be of legal age</mark>":

<div width="300px" style="position: center"><img src="./assets/venn2_example.png" width="auto" height="100px"></div>

The logical relationship is illustrated as a set relationship: The shading makes it clear that there can be no one who is allowed to buy alcohol but is not of legal age. There may be further restrictions. For example, you must not be legally incapacitated. It is also said that legal age is a necessary condition for purchasing alcohol. Conversely, being allowed to purchase alcohol is a sufficient condition for inferring legal age. Visualizing logical relationships using set diagrams should help to avoid confusing sufficient and necessary conditions.

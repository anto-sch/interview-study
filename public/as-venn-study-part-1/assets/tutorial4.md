#### Task Types

Each task requires you to read and comprehend a short passage, then answer one question. Before you give your answer, it is necessary to **look at the cues** by clicking on the 'Hint' button. The cues will then be revealed to you, you can replay them as often as you want. On the right-hand side is a virtual sketchpad. We encourage you to take notes or sketch out your thoughts, if you find it helpful!

The questions require a wide range of skills involved in logical reasoning, including:

- Drawing well-supported conclusions
- Reasoning by analogy
- Determining how additional evidence affects an argument
- Detecting assumptions made by particular arguments
- Identifying flaws in arguments

All of these skills build on the ability to recognize the parts of an argument and their relationships. For the tasks that require you to draw conclusions, the premises of the inference will be visualized. For other tasks, you will be presented with incomplete logical inferences and asked about missing assumptions. In this case, the Venn diagrams will first show you only the premises of the argument and then the premises combined with the conclusion. This way you can compare the two, to see which assumptions are required. Here is an example:

<div width="300px" style="position: center, margin-bottom: 20px"><img src="./assets/hint_example.png" width="auto" height="250px"></div>

Always look at the hint first, then decide on an answer. Do not pick a response simply because it is a true statement. Although true, it may not answer the question posed. Answer each question on the basis of the information that is given. Work within the context provided by the passage.

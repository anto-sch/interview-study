# Introduction

Thank you for participating in our experiment!In this study, we investigate how people solve tasks that require logical reasoning. You will first receive an introduction and training on the type of tasks you will have to solve. Afterwards you will be presented with five tasks. For each task, you will be asked to describe your reasoning process and answer some open questions. At the end of the experiment, we will conduct a brief interview on ways to support people in their reasoning.

Completing the experiment and interview will take about 45 minutes. You can terminate the experiment any time. After reading and consenting to the following terms of the study, the experiment will begin.

Your demographic data (age, gender, occupation) as well as the interview audio will be recorded in anonymized form. The anonymized data will be analyzed and possibly shared in an openly available data repository alongside the publication of the results in a scientific journal or conference proceeding.

#### Task Types

Various types of tasks are presented, for which combinations of the three types of cues, colored highlighting, Euler diagrams, and Venn diagrams are displayed. 

Each task requires you to read and comprehend a short passage, then answer one question. The questions require a wide range of skills involved in logical reasoning, including:

- Drawing well-supported conclusions
- Reasoning by analogy
- Determining how additional evidence affects an argument
- Detecting assumptions made by particular arguments
- Identifying flaws in arguments

All of these skills build on the ability to recognize the parts of an argument and their relationships. For the tasks that require you to draw conclusions, the premises of the inference will be visualized. For other tasks, you will be presented with incomplete logical inferences and asked about missing assumptions. In this case, the Venn diagrams will first show you only the premises of the argument and then the premises combined with the conclusion. This way you can compare the two, to see which assumptions are required. Here is an example:

<div width="300px" style="position: center, margin-bottom: 20px"><img src="./assets/hint_example.png" width="auto" height="250px"></div>

You will first be presented with a task without any hints. Read the task carefully, including the possible answers. The aim is to understand the task linguistically, not to solve it yet. When you have finished reading, let us know. Then start solving the task out loud. Make it clear when you have finally decided on a solution.

Do not pick a response simply because it is a true statement. Although true, it may not answer the question posed. Answer each question on the basis of the information that is given. Work within the context provided by the passage.

After you have given your answer, you will be shown graphical cues for the task. Go through your thinking process again and try to relate it to what the cues show. If your reasoning changes based on the cues, please let us know. Afterwards, we will ask you some questions on how you perceive the cues.

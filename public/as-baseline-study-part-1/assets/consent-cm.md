# Consent

I have been informed in writing about the study and the experimental procedure and agree to participate in the study.

I agree to the described collection and processing of data (demographic data, questionnaire responses, reaction times). This data will be recorded and analyzed anonymously using my Prolific ID. It is not possible for the researchers who are conducting this study to link my Prolific ID to my name and therefore the data collected cannot be traced back to me. I am aware that the researchers will delete my Prolific ID after study completion from the data file and therefore I cannot request the deletion of my data from this time onwards (i.e., 4 weeks after study completion).

I agree that my anonymized data may be used for research purposes. For this purpose, they will be stored on hard drives at the Heidelberg University for at least 10 years after data evaluation or
at least 10 years after publication of a publication on this study. I understand that participation in the study is voluntary and that I can terminate my participation at any time without giving reasons.

# Introduction

Thank you for participating in our experiment!

In this study, we investigate how people solve tasks that require logical reasoning. **Note that this study consists of two parts**. After you complete the first part today, you will receive an invitation to **complete the second part tomorrow**. Each part takes about 30 minutes to complete.

In this first part, you will first receive an introduction and training on the type of tasks you will have to solve. Afterwards you will be presented with 10 logical reasoning tasks. In-between tasks there will be questions on how you came to a solution. You can terminate the experiment any time. After reading and consenting to the following terms of the study, the experiment will begin.

Your demographic data (age, gender, occupation), your answers to all questions, and your reaction time will be recorded in anonymized form. The anonymized data will be analyzed and possibly shared in an openly available data repository alongside the publication of the results in a scientific journal or conference proceeding.

Please read the following statement carefully.

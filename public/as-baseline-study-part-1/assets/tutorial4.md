#### Task Types

Each task requires you to read and comprehend a short passage, then answer one question. On the righthand side is a virtual sketchpad. We encourage you to take notes or sketch out your thoughts, if you find it helpful!

The questions require a wide range of skills involved in logical reasoning, including:

- Drawing well-supported conclusions
- Reasoning by analogy
- Determining how additional evidence affects an argument
- Detecting assumptions made by particular arguments
- Identifying flaws in arguments

All of these skills build on the ability to recognize the parts of an argument and their relationships.

Do not pick a response simply because it is a true statement. Although true, it may not answer the question posed. Answer each question on the basis of the information that is given. Work within the context provided by the passage.

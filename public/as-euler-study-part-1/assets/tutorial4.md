##### Solving Tasks with Visual Cues

For the tasks that require you to draw conclusions, the premises in the context will be visualized. For other tasks, the context describes incomplete or incorrect arguments and ask about required assumptions or flaws in the reasoning. In this case, the Euler diagrams will  show you the premises and the conclusion of the argument. This way you can check how they can be combined to see which assumptions are required or where errors occured. Here is an example:

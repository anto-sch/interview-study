#### Task Types

As in the first part, each task requires you to read and understand a short passage and then answer a question about it. **This time you will not be shown any cues**. However, on the right-hand side is a virtual sketchpad. Feel free to take notes or sketch out your thoughts if you find it helpful!

Do not pick a response simply because it is a true statement. Although true, it may not answer the question posed. Answer each question on the basis of the information that is given. Work within the context provided by the passage.
